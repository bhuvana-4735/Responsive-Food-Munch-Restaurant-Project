Used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap elements to build a website with some interactive web pages that guide to 
the tourist places of India based on our view requirements. This web application is designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for customers looking to explore and order delicious meals from our restaurant. The project focuses on responsiveness, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience across various devices and screen sizes.
